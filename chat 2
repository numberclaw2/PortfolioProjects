customer_dialogue_start_time: 23.73
customer_dialogue: Sure. It's [CUSTOM_NUMBER_SEQUENCE]

agent_dialogue_start_time: 30.23
agent_dialogue: Wonderful. Thank you so much. And how may I be of help for you today?

agent_dialogue_start_time: 50.13
agent_dialogue: oh,

agent_dialogue_start_time: 54.33
agent_dialogue: right. Yeah yeah.

customer_dialogue_start_time: 34.43
customer_dialogue: Well my my phone is not working well and I I shattered the screen I'm talking to you on it but my son-in-law gave me a new phone that he did not like so I'm hoping I I now how nice right? I mean it'll work fine for me so wage rate I want to make sure well I don't know how to transfer the information from my phone to this new phone and I was hoping you could help me with that.

customer_dialogue_start_time: 80.53
customer_dialogue: Okay.

agent_dialogue_start_time: 69.73
agent_dialogue: Okay, sure, not a problem. What we are going to do? We will process the activation first so that we can activate the new phone that he gave you your number. So that is going to work. Okay, all right.

customer_dialogue_start_time: 91.23
customer_dialogue: Yeah.

agent_dialogue_start_time: 84.23
agent_dialogue: And then this is this is what we're going to. I would suggest for you to do this, okay? I understand that your your was it for your name.

customer_dialogue_start_time: 96.93
customer_dialogue: My son-in-law. Yeah.

agent_dialogue_start_time: 98.51
agent_dialogue: Your son-in-law. Yeah, I understand that. You said that your son-in-law has given you a phone that he is not using, but if you'd like, you can go ahead and add insurance in to your account. Okay? So if you are going to add insurance after 30 days, you can go ahead and file a claim because we have an open enrollment right now. So, when you file a claim after 30 days, you will be given

agent_dialogue_start_time: 125.61
agent_dialogue: 3:30 place. Your

customer_dialogue_start_time: 122.67
customer_dialogue: A claim explain it, you mean, file insurance. Now on my old phone,

agent_dialogue_start_time: 131.12
agent_dialogue: that is right. So we can add insurance first, but you are unable to file a claim not until 30 days because we have an open enrollment right now.

customer_dialogue_start_time: 140.47
customer_dialogue: Okay.

agent_dialogue_start_time: 140.31
agent_dialogue: Because in cases like crack on the screen, it's going to be unlimited repair. But say for example, it's really something that needs to be replaced and that's the time that they can process or replacement for you.

agent_dialogue_start_time: 154.71
agent_dialogue: if you're

customer_dialogue_start_time: 154.17
customer_dialogue: And how much is the insurance?

agent_dialogue_start_time: 156.51
agent_dialogue: sure it's $19 every month. So that's already covers lost or stolen water damage, malfunction issues, unlimited repair, and the crack screen. So that at least you don't have to buy a phone that has a full price of sitting around $700 a thousand.

customer_dialogue_start_time: 177.97
customer_dialogue: Right. However, I have a free phone in my other hand.

customer_dialogue_start_time: 190.97
customer_dialogue: Oh, okay.

customer_dialogue_start_time: 194.73
customer_dialogue: Okay. No, that's fine.

agent_dialogue_start_time: 184.21
agent_dialogue: Oh yeah, but still we can we can use that. I was just offering you your other option. Just in case you wanted to file a claim. Yeah, it was just something that you need to know as well as your option.

customer_dialogue_start_time: 197.87
customer_dialogue: I understand, thank you. Okay.

agent_dialogue_start_time: 200.31
agent_dialogue: No worries. Now on that phone, could you please? What's the make and model of that phone [PERSON_NAME]?

customer_dialogue_start_time: 208.73
customer_dialogue: The new one.

agent_dialogue_start_time: 209.61
agent_dialogue: Yeah.

agent_dialogue_start_time: 220.48
agent_dialogue: Sure.

customer_dialogue_start_time: 211.33
customer_dialogue: Okay, it is I know let's see. What is it? Say it is. It's a I'm going to read it to you. It's a it's a t m o r e v v, l 6 X pro 5G.

agent_dialogue_start_time: 233.78
agent_dialogue: Let's try to see if that is going to be.

agent_dialogue_start_time: 241.87
agent_dialogue: It's going to be compatible with your Verizon services. Let's try to see

customer_dialogue_start_time: 249.23
customer_dialogue: Yeah, this is through T-Mobile.

customer_dialogue_start_time: 264.93
customer_dialogue: Okay.

agent_dialogue_start_time: 253.58
agent_dialogue: Yeah, that's the thing because when you said the make and model, are you already can say that that's for the mobile. So it might not be compatible. But we can try. Can you provide me with that? Do you know how to get the IMEI number from that device?

customer_dialogue_start_time: 272.43
customer_dialogue: On the new one.

agent_dialogue_start_time: 274.18
agent_dialogue: Yes, and the new one.

customer_dialogue_start_time: 276.73
customer_dialogue: The IMEI. Yes, I have it right here.

agent_dialogue_start_time: 279.98
agent_dialogue: He very good. Can you share it with me?

customer_dialogue_start_time: 284.36
customer_dialogue: Sure. It's you ready? It's long. It's 816.

agent_dialogue_start_time: 286.88
agent_dialogue: Mhm. Yeah, you know it's a series of numbers.

customer_dialogue_start_time: 291.36
customer_dialogue: Yeah, it's 865. No, I'm sorry. I'm going to start over [CUSTOM_NUMBER_SEQUENCE].

customer_dialogue_start_time: 301.13
customer_dialogue: [CUSTOM_NUMBER_SEQUENCE].

agent_dialogue_start_time: 310.87
agent_dialogue: Okay. I'll go ahead and try because the acceptable or the compatible IMEI numbers, which is accepted by, Verizon usually starts with 350. We can try okay.

customer_dialogue_start_time: 324.36
customer_dialogue: Okay.

agent_dialogue_start_time: 325.68
agent_dialogue: All right, I'm doing it right now.

customer_dialogue_start_time: 338.61
customer_dialogue: That's what I have a feeling.

agent_dialogue_start_time: 335.1
agent_dialogue: Yeah, so it cannot be used, the device cannot be used and is not compatible with Verizon network.

customer_dialogue_start_time: 345.11
customer_dialogue: Okay, so I think what I'll probably do is take the insurance and I can't use it for 30 days. Is that it?

customer_dialogue_start_time: 356.71
customer_dialogue: Okay.

agent_dialogue_start_time: 354.4
agent_dialogue: That's right, so you have to wait after 30 days first because that is there that is there agreement? It's just so happened that they now they do have an open enrollment so you can understand how that sided and then after 30 days you can go ahead and start filing a claim. But I'm very worried of you [PERSON_NAME] as of the moment within 30 days you have no phone to use. You can fucking for me. So are you able to give the make a phone call?

agent_dialogue_start_time: 389.3
agent_dialogue: Big crack.

customer_dialogue_start_time: 381.71
customer_dialogue: I am. I am. It's just the the front of the screen has got like a big like a spiderweb. Yeah. It's a big spider web page.

customer_dialogue: Yes, yes.

agent_dialogue_start_time: 397.7
