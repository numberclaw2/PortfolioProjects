You are being instructed to complete several tasks and manage specific responsibilities related to the hierarchy mapping, dashboard development, and project clarifications. Here’s a clear breakdown of your instructions:

Primary Tasks You’re Responsible For

1. Work on Hierarchy Mapping
	•	You are expected to:
	•	Use the reference table that your manager will provide.
	•	Collaborate with Matt, Wen, and the team to define how hierarchies (job titles and levels) should be organized for the Care Project.
	•	Schedule a meeting with the team to finalize these hierarchy rollups.
	•	Key Goals:
	•	Ensure clear definitions of hierarchy levels (e.g., supervisor → senior manager → VP).
	•	Confirm whether levels will be represented as Level 1, 2, 3, or some other structure.
	•	Resolve discrepancies where titles don’t align (e.g., missing Director roles).

2. Prepare for Dashboard Development
	•	Before starting the dashboard:
	•	Wait for hierarchy definitions to be finalized during the meeting.
	•	Understand that dashboard rollups depend on these definitions and changes later could lead to rework.
	•	Once hierarchy mapping is resolved:
	•	Start building the Care Project dashboard using the rollup data.

3. Permissions for the Chat Data Dashboard
	•	For the Chat Data (Inside Sales) dashboard:
	•	Ensure row-level security permissions and user group permissions are correctly added to the dashboard before moving it to production.
	•	Confirm permissions match existing dashboards (copy as needed).
	•	Coordinate with TJ for the final move to production after receiving sign-off from the team.

4. Clarify Distinctions Between Projects
	•	Clear up any confusion between:
	•	Chat data (inside sales project): Already in the sandbox, waiting for sign-off.
	•	Care Project: Pending hierarchy mapping, not yet in production.
	•	Call data project: A separate project (likely related to reviewing calls).
	•	Ensure clear communication with stakeholders (e.g., Robbie) to avoid further mix-ups.

Secondary Expectations
	•	Use your functional ID for accessing and working with data, as discussed.
	•	Follow up with Robbie to ensure he is informed about progress and expectations for each project.
	•	Manage priorities effectively given your workload and holiday schedule.

Summary of Immediate Actions
	1.	Receive the reference table and share it with Matt, Wen, and the team.
	2.	Set up a meeting to finalize hierarchy definitions for the Care Project.
	3.	Ensure permissions for the Chat Data Dashboard are complete when moving to production.
	4.	Separate and clarify your involvement in the Chat, Care, and Call data projects.
	5.	Update Robbie and other stakeholders as needed.
