-- Step 1: Create Temporary Table to Identify Repeats
IF OBJECT_ID('tempdb..#TempRepeats') IS NOT NULL
    DROP TABLE #TempRepeats;

SELECT 
    user_id,
    emp_nm,
    COUNT(*) AS repeats
INTO #TempRepeats
FROM care.dbo.rmc_care_outbound_calls_same_name_detail
WHERE 
    call_dt > DATEADD(month, -24, GETDATE())  -- Last 24 months
GROUP BY 
    user_id,
    emp_nm
HAVING 
    COUNT(*) > 2;

-- Step 2: Main Query to Join with Temporary Table and Get Detailed Interactions with Filtered Count
SELECT 
    a.*, 
    b.repeats AS interaction_count  -- Adding count of interactions (greater than 2) from #TempRepeats
FROM 
    care.dbo.rmc_care_outbound_calls_same_name_detail a
JOIN 
    #TempRepeats b ON a.user_id = b.user_id
ORDER BY 
    a.user_id;
