Mapping Fields from the Inside Sales Dataset to the User Scorecard

Here is the preliminary mapping based on the fields available in the Inside Sales dataset and the fields required for the User Scorecard:

Mapped Fields

	1.	User Identification:
	•	complio_user_id → DIRECTOR_USER_ID
	•	complio_user_nm → DIRECTOR_VENDOR_NM
	2.	Metrics:
	•	Metric Num Value → METRIC_NUM_VALUE
	•	Metric Den Value → METRIC_DEN_VALUE
	•	Metric Num Nm → METRIC_NUM_NM
	•	Metric Den Nm → METRIC_DEN_NM
	3.	Hierarchy Dimensions:
	•	AGENT_AREA_DESC → SUPERVISOR_USER_ID
	•	AGENT_DISTRICT_DESC → SUPV_NM
	•	AGENT_REG_DESC → ASSOC_DIR/VENDOR_LOCATION
	4.	Month-over-Month Fields:
	•	MOM_MTH → MOM_MTH
	•	Calculation_4378624796690030606 → MoM Show Panel
	5.	Calculated Metrics:
	•	Metric percentages and ratios will need to be recreated using the fields above (e.g., METRIC_NUM_VALUE / METRIC_DEN_VALUE).

Next Steps: Step-by-Step Instructions to Build the User Scorecard

	1.	Create the 1. User Download Worksheet:
	•	Data Source: Connect to the Inside Sales dataset.
	•	Add Fields:
	•	User fields: DIRECTOR_USER_ID, DIRECTOR_VENDOR_NM.
	•	Metrics: METRIC_NUM_VALUE, METRIC_DEN_VALUE, and calculated percentage fields.
	•	Hierarchy fields: SUPERVISOR_USER_ID, SUPV_NM.
	•	Filters:
	•	Add filters for hierarchy dimensions (e.g., by area, district, region).
	•	Visualization: Use a table or cross-tab to display user-level metrics.
	2.	Create the 1. User MoM Download Worksheet:
	•	Data Source: Use the Inside Sales dataset.
	•	Add Fields:
	•	Include MOM_MTH for Month-over-Month comparisons.
	•	Use calculated fields for MoM metrics (e.g., ratios, percentages).
	•	Filters: Add a date range filter on MOM_MTH.
	3.	Rebuild Calculated Fields:
	•	Create calculated fields for:
	•	Metric Percentages: (METRIC_NUM_VALUE / METRIC_DEN_VALUE) * 100.
	•	Month-over-Month Comparisons: (Current Month Metric - Previous Month Metric) / Previous Month Metric.
	4.	Build the User Scorecard Dashboard:
	•	Add the worksheets (1. User Download, 1. User MoM Download) to a dashboard.
	•	Include interactivity:
	•	Filters for hierarchy levels.
	•	Toggles for switching between metrics or views.
	5.	Test the Scorecard:
	•	Verify metrics and calculations for a few sample users.
	•	Test filters and toggles for functionality.
