Absolutely! Let’s break down Step 1: Creating the 1. User Download Worksheet in a beginner-friendly way.

Step 1: Creating the 1. User Download Worksheet

1. Open Tableau and Connect to the Inside Sales Data

	1.	Open Tableau Desktop.
	2.	On the start page, click Connect → choose the data type (e.g., Excel, database).
	3.	Locate and select the Inside Sales dataset.
	4.	Drag the required data source to the canvas in the Data Source tab.

2. Create a New Worksheet

	1.	In Tableau, click the New Worksheet button at the bottom of the interface (a small sheet icon).
	2.	Rename the worksheet:
	•	Right-click the worksheet tab (e.g., “Sheet 1”) → click Rename → type 1. User Download.

3. Build the Table (Cross-Tab)

Tableau uses a drag-and-drop interface to build visualizations. Here’s how to create the user download table:
	•	Add User Identification Fields:
	1.	Drag DIRECTOR_USER_ID from the Data Pane to Rows.
	2.	Drag DIRECTOR_VENDOR_NM to Rows (to display the user’s name).
	•	Add Metrics:
	1.	Drag METRIC_NUM_VALUE to Columns.
	2.	Drag METRIC_DEN_VALUE to Columns.
	3.	Create a calculated field for percentages:
	•	Go to the top menu → click Analysis → select Create Calculated Field.
	•	Name it Metric Percentage and use the formula:

[METRIC_NUM_VALUE] / [METRIC_DEN_VALUE]


	•	Click OK.
	•	Drag Metric Percentage to Columns.

	•	Add Hierarchy Fields:
	1.	Drag fields like SUPERVISOR_USER_ID, SUPV_NM to Rows under the user ID and name fields to create hierarchy.

4. Add Filters

Filters allow you to refine the data displayed in the worksheet.
	•	Drag the following fields from the Data Pane to the Filters shelf:
	•	SUPERVISOR_USER_ID (to filter by supervisor).
	•	SUPV_NM (to filter by region or district).
	•	Configure the filters:
	•	Right-click each field in the Filters shelf → click Show Filter.
	•	Filters will appear on the right side of the worksheet for user interaction.

5. Customize the Table

	•	Format headers:
	•	Right-click a column or row header → click Format → customize font size, alignment, and colors.
	•	Adjust the number format for percentages:
	•	Right-click Metric Percentage in the Columns shelf → click Format.
	•	Set the format to Percentage with one decimal place.

6. Validate the Worksheet

	•	Check the data displayed in the table to ensure it matches your expectations.
	•	Cross-check a few rows to verify metrics are accurate (e.g., Metric Percentage = METRIC_NUM_VALUE / METRIC_DEN_VALUE).

7. Save Your Work

	•	Save the workbook by going to File → Save As → name the file appropriately (e.g., User_Scorecard_Workbook.twbx).

Your 1. User Download worksheet is now ready!

This will display user-level data, including metrics and hierarchy details, with filters for refining the view.
