Got it! Since you’re using Jupyter Notebooks in Sphere Engine, I’ll provide Python code that you can copy and run directly in your notebook.

Step 1: Load the Data

First, upload your CSV file to Sphere Engine, then use the following code to load and preview the data:

import pandas as pd

# Load dataset
df = pd.read_csv("Sample - Superstore 2.csv", encoding="latin1")

# Display first 5 rows
df.head()



⸻

Step 2: Check for Missing Values

# Check for missing values
df.isnull().sum()

If any columns have missing data, we can decide whether to fill or drop them.

⸻

Step 3: Convert Date Columns to Datetime

# Convert 'Order Date' and 'Ship Date' to datetime format
df['Order Date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['Order Date'])
df['Ship Date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['Ship Date'])



⸻

Step 4: Remove Duplicates

# Remove duplicate rows if any exist
df = df.drop_duplicates()



⸻

Step 5: Summary Statistics

# Get an overview of numerical columns
df.describe()

This will help you see average sales, profit, discounts, etc.

⸻

Step 6: Formulate Key Questions

Here are some questions you might explore in your analysis:
	•	Which region generates the most revenue?
	•	Which product categories are the most profitable?
	•	What is the impact of discounts on profits?
	•	Which customer segments contribute the most to sales?
	•	What is the average order processing time (Ship Date - Order Date)?

Would you like me to generate graphs to visualize some of these trends?
