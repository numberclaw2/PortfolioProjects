This is a long and detailed critique, focusing on eternal security (also called “once saved, always saved”) and its connection to the gospel. 
I’ll analyze the key claims in light of Scripture and evaluate their biblical accuracy, especially where they critique Pastor Philip Anthony Mitchell (Pam). 
Below is a structured breakdown.

Core Criticism: Eternal Security

The critic’s main argument is that Pastor Mitchell denies the doctrine of eternal security, which the critic equates with the gospel itself. They argue:
	1.	Eternal security is clearly taught in Scripture.
	2.	Denying eternal security is equivalent to denying the sufficiency of Christ’s atonement.
	3.	Teaching that believers can lose salvation is a “false gospel.”

Let’s analyze these claims.

Biblical Analysis of Eternal Security

1. Key Scriptures Cited in Support of Eternal Security

The critic cites several passages that are foundational for the doctrine:
	•	John 10:28-29: “I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish; no one will snatch them out of my hand.”
	•	Philippians 1:6: “He who began a good work in you will carry it on to completion until the day of Christ Jesus.”
	•	1 John 5:13: “These things I have written… so that you may know that you have eternal life.”
	•	Ephesians 4:30: “You were sealed for the day of redemption.”
	•	Romans 8:38-39: Nothing can separate believers from the love of God.

These passages do seem to support the idea that salvation, once granted, is secure. Specifically:
	•	John 10 emphasizes that no external force can separate believers from Christ.
	•	Philippians 1 assures believers of God’s continued sanctifying work.
	•	Ephesians 4 highlights the “sealing” of the Holy Spirit as a guarantee of future redemption.

2. Counterarguments Against Eternal Security

Pastor Mitchell’s sermon suggests that sin can jeopardize salvation, which aligns more with an Arminian theology (free will) perspective. While the critic rejects this, there are biblical passages that are often cited against eternal security:
	•	Hebrews 6:4-6: “It is impossible for those who have once been enlightened… if they fall away, to be brought back to repentance.”
	•	Hebrews 10:26-27: “If we deliberately keep on sinning… no sacrifice for sins is left.”
	•	Matthew 24:13: “The one who endures to the end will be saved.”
	•	2 Peter 2:20-22: Describes those who “escape the corruption of the world” but are “again entangled” and worse off than before.

These passages emphasize perseverance, obedience, and warnings against falling away, which seem to challenge the idea of guaranteed salvation regardless of behavior.

Theological Balance
	•	Eternal Security vs. Perseverance of the Saints:
	•	Reformed theology teaches eternal security as part of the perseverance of the saints—true believers will continue in faith because God sustains them.
	•	Arminian theology emphasizes that believers can choose to fall away, particularly through persistent rebellion or apostasy.

Neither position denies salvation by grace through faith (Ephesians 2:8-9). The disagreement is over whether a saved individual can ultimately forfeit their salvation.

Is Denying Eternal Security a “False Gospel”?

No. While eternal security is important to some theological frameworks, it is not a universally agreed-upon component of the gospel. The gospel, biblically speaking, centers on:
	•	The life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ (1 Corinthians 15:1-4).
	•	Salvation by grace through faith in Christ (Ephesians 2:8-9).
	•	Repentance and belief in Jesus as Lord and Savior (Mark 1:15; Romans 10:9).

Pastor Mitchell may preach against eternal security, but this does not inherently mean he denies salvation by grace through faith or preaches a works-based gospel.

Criticisms of Mitchell’s Sermon

1. “Works-Based Salvation” Accusation

The critic accuses Mitchell of promoting works-based salvation, pointing to:
	•	His emphasis on resisting sin (e.g., “deal aggressively with sin”).
	•	His claim that certain unrepentant sins put a believer at risk of hell.

Analysis:
	•	Mitchell’s language about sin is strong, but he does not explicitly say salvation is earned by works.
	•	Many passages (e.g., James 2:17, 1 John 3:9) emphasize that a saving faith leads to transformed behavior and a struggle against sin.
	•	It is biblically consistent to warn believers about sin without teaching that salvation is earned by works. For example, Paul warns in Galatians 5:19-21 that those who live in sin “will not inherit the kingdom of God.”

2. Is Resisting Sin a “Work”?

The critic argues that resisting sin is a “work” and therefore cannot be tied to salvation.

Biblical Response:
	•	Resisting sin is evidence of salvation, not the basis for it. Philippians 2:12-13 says, “Work out your salvation with fear and trembling, for it is God who works in you.”
	•	True saving faith
