Sermon Notes: “Defamation for Dominance” by Pastor Kenneth McFarland

Date: February 18, 2025
Scripture: Matthew 21:23-27

I. Introduction: The Power of Defamation
	•	Pastor Kenneth opens by explaining why 2819 Church is considered “radical.”
	•	He reflects on catastrophic events (e.g., asteroid impact, nuclear war) that could destroy the Earth.
	•	However, one overlooked yet equally dangerous force is the defamation of God, the Gospel, and Jesus Christ.

Defining Defamation
	•	Defamation = false information, slander, or libel designed to degrade, dismantle, or deconstruct the truth.
	•	This has been happening since the beginning of time.
	•	Example: Adam & Eve
	•	Satan twisted God’s words in the Garden, saying, “God just doesn’t want you to be like Him.”
	•	This single lie caused sin to enter the world, impacting all generations.
	•	Even today, people defame God without realizing the consequences.
	•	God’s Response:
	•	He commands us to bear one another’s burdens (over 100 “one another” commands in Scripture).
	•	God hates division; sowing discord is an abomination (Proverbs 6:16-19).

II. Theme: “Defamation for Dominance”
	•	Text: Matthew 21:23-27
	•	Jesus enters the temple, teaching the people.
	•	The chief priests and elders challenge Him:
	•	“By what authority are you doing these things? Who gave you this authority?”
	•	These are the stewards of God’s temple—yet they do not recognize the Messiah!

Why Were They Challenging Jesus?
	•	Luke 19:45-48 gives context:
	•	Jesus drove out the merchants, saying, “My house shall be a house of prayer, but you have made it a den of robbers.”
	•	He taught daily, and the people hung on His words.
	•	The religious leaders saw their power diminishing and sought to destroy Him.
	•	The Irony:
	•	The chief priests were supposed to teach God’s word daily.
	•	The elders were supposed to shepherd God’s people.
	•	But Jesus did their job better than them—and they hated Him for it.

III. The Root of Their Insecurity
	•	The religious leaders felt obsolete because Jesus exposed their failure.
	•	They assumed a man gave Jesus authority, and they wanted to prove their own authority was higher.
	•	Modern Application:
	•	Have you ever felt jealous when someone else does your job better than you?
	•	This is how the religious leaders felt—Jesus made them look bad.
	•	Pastor Kenneth’s Key Quote:
	•	“Our only real security is in integrity.”
	•	Your security should not be in your position or title but in your character.

IV. The Danger of Seeking Glory Without God
	•	Jesus said in Mark 10:42 – The greatest among you shall be a servant.
	•	Many want:
	•	Glory without God
	•	Honor without holiness
	•	Leadership without servanthood
	•	Reality Check:
	•	“If serving is beneath you, then leadership is above you.”

Wrong Motives in Ministry
	•	Some people serve only to get promoted.
	•	Example: People watching Miss Rhonda & Don, waiting for their turn to be seen.
	•	David’s Example:
	•	Anointed as a boy but waited 20 years before becoming king.
	•	Many people don’t want to wait on God’s timing.
	•	True Test of the Heart:
	•	When told “Not yet,” how do you react?
	•	Some people leave ministries when denied a position.
	•	Instead, God calls us to submit and be broken.

V. Jesus’ Response to Defamation
	•	Instead of answering their question, Jesus challenges them back:
	•	“The baptism of John—was it from Heaven or from man?”
	•	Why did Jesus bring up John the Baptist?
	•	John publicly called out the Pharisees as a “brood of vipers.”
	•	He preached repentance and pointed directly to Jesus as the Messiah (Matthew 3:1-12).
	•	The religious leaders knew John’s baptism was from God—but refused to admit it.

The Dilemma of the Pharisees
	1.	If they say John’s authority was from Heaven, Jesus would ask why they didn’t believe him.
	2.	If they say John’s authority was from man, the people would turn against them.
	3.	So they cowardly respond: “We do not know.”

	•	Jesus’ Final Response:
	•	“Then neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things.”
	•	Jesus didn’t defend Himself—He let their own hypocrisy speak for itself.

VI. Key Takeaways
	1.	We Must Die to Ourselves Daily
	•	Jesus calls us to die daily (Luke 9:23).
	•	If you refuse to die to your desires now, you will face the second death (hell) later.
	•	“Two deaths will happen—one now (daily surrender) or one later (eternal judgment).”
	2.	We Don’t Have to Defend Ourselves
	•	Jesus didn’t respond to every accusation—neither should we.
	•	When secure in our identity in Christ, we don’t need validation from others.
	•	Just because someone asks a question doesn’t mean you have to answer.
	3.	Obedience Over Preference
	•	Many ask God for His will, but when He says “No”, they still do what they want.
	•	Instead of living in God’s perfect will, they live in His permissive will—with consequences.
	4.	Integrity Matters More Than Status
	•	What you do in private determines how God uses you in public.
	•	True authority comes from God, not from man-made titles.

VII. Final Prayer
	•	Pastor Kenneth prays for the congregation to:
	•	Ring out their hearts before God.
	•	Desire God’s will over their own.
	•	Be broken in a way that allows God to use them.
	•	Repent, because the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand.

Reflection Questions for Small Group Discussion:
	1.	How do you handle criticism and challenges to your faith?
	2.	In what areas do you struggle with seeking glory over servanthood?
	3.	How can you start dying daily to your own desires?
	4.	Are you secure enough in your identity in Christ to let go of validation from others?

This was a deep and challenging message! Are you planning to share it with your small group, or did any part stand out to you personally?
