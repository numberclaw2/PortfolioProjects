Here’s a detailed analysis and actionable plan based on the transcript and meeting notes. I’ve organized this into Key Action Items, Issues and Challenges, and Recommendations, providing more context for each.

Key Action Items and Implementation Plan

1. Utilization Dashboard Access
	•	Action: Ensure the BI team has access to the Utilization Dashboard.
	•	Steps:
	•	Verify current access permissions for the BI team.
	•	Work with IT or database admins to grant necessary access.
	•	Test access to confirm functionality.

2. Fix Active Report Date Selection
	•	Action: Investigate why the “ReportDate” filter does not allow selecting the two most recent dates on the Scorecard and Rep tabs.
	•	Steps:
	•	Verify if the issue is intentional (by design) or an oversight.
	•	Check date logic in the dashboard backend (e.g., SQL queries, Tableau/BI tool configurations).
	•	Modify the filter to ensure the two most recent dates are selectable if it was unintentional.

3. Enhance Data Tables for Outlier Detection
	•	Action: Update data tables to enable outlier detection, similar to TESR summary reports.
	•	Steps:
	•	Review current data structure and limitations.
	•	Design enhancements to capture key metrics (e.g., exception volume or performance outliers).
	•	Implement logic to flag data points exceeding defined thresholds.
	•	Test and validate outlier reports before deployment.

4. Standardize Naming and Filters
	•	Action: Update filters and naming conventions for consistency.
	•	Steps:
	•	Capitalize “Ad” in “AdLocNm” on all tabs.
	•	Decide on abbreviation or full names for all filter titles across Scorecard, Monthly Trends, and Rep tabs.
	•	Ensure filters are in the same order across tabs (e.g., “Director, AD, Supervisor”).
	•	Test changes to confirm functionality and ease of use.

5. Fix Dashboard Links
	•	Action: Repair the link to the Inside Sales Complio Toolkit on Scorecard, Monthly Trends, and Rep tabs.
	•	Steps:
	•	Identify and fix broken or outdated URLs.
	•	Validate functionality for all three tabs.

6. Align Targets and Definitions
	•	Action: Align “DateTimeframe” data in Rep View with hover-over details.
	•	Steps:
	•	Identify discrepancies in date ranges (e.g., “924 to 1024” vs. “81 to 1024”).
	•	Review the calculation or parameter generating date ranges.
	•	Correct tooltip logic to display accurate time frames.

7. Sort Logic Updates
	•	Action: Adjust sorting to toggle accurately between volume and percentage.
	•	Steps:
	•	Confirm default sort logic is consistent across dashboards.
	•	Modify sorting logic based on user feedback or requirements (e.g., default to volume if it’s more critical).

8. Remove Excess Space
	•	Action: Reduce unnecessary white space at the bottom of tabs.
	•	Steps:
	•	Adjust container height for all dashboard views to ensure consistency.
	•	Confirm that no critical data is truncated in the updated layout.

9. Address Duplicate Rep Names
	•	Action: Fix duplicates in the “RepName” column caused by USWIN/username discrepancies.
	•	Steps:
	•	Review cases like Kristina Henley and Nariah Baymon.
	•	Identify root causes (e.g., multiple employee IDs for one user).
	•	Consolidate duplicates by using unique identifiers like User ID.

10. Language Update
	•	Action: Update the language for “RMC recommends utilizing exception volume…” on the Rep tab.
	•	Steps:
	•	Collaborate with stakeholders to draft replacement language.
	•	Ensure the new text provides clear, actionable guidance.

Issues and Challenges

1. Director Data Cleanup
	•	Challenge: Directors who are no longer part of Inside Sales appear in filters.
	•	Plan:
	•	Review the current data source for director names.
	•	Cross-check against an updated list of active directors.
	•	Remove or archive inactive directors from both Scorecard and Rep tabs.

2. Average Calculation Discrepancies
	•	Challenge: Averages do not update based on filters on some tabs.
	•	Plan:
	•	Validate average calculation logic in Scorecard and Rep views.
	•	Align logic to ensure calculations reflect selected filters accurately.

3. User Engagement
	•	Challenge: Low dashboard usage post-launch.
	•	Plan:
	•	Provide training sessions tailored to actionable insights.
	•	Roll out a pilot alert system to engage users (e.g., nudges for key metrics).
	•	Monitor usage trends and iterate based on feedback.

4. Data Synchronization
	•	Challenge: Delays and discrepancies in report dates between sandbox and production.
	•	Plan:
	•	Investigate refresh schedules and timing differences.
	•	Align sandbox and production environments to reduce inconsistencies.
	•	Document the synchronization process to prevent future misalignment.

5. Filter Functionality
	•	Challenge: Filters behave inconsistently across tabs.
	•	Plan:
	•	Standardize filter logic across all views.
	•	Test filters to ensure accurate data is displayed regardless of tab.

Recommendations

1. Pilot Automated Alerts
	•	Use thresholds (e.g., top 10% of underperformers) for nudges.
	•	Engage stakeholders to refine alert criteria.

2. Streamline Training and Onboarding
	•	Provide hands-on sessions with examples of actionable insights.
	•	Develop a knowledge base or documentation for common dashboard tasks.

3. Conduct a Data Audit
	•	Validate dashboard data against source tables to ensure accuracy.
	•	Address discrepancies in calculated metrics or date ranges.

4. Simplify Dashboard Design
	•	Reduce excess white space.
	•	Ensure uniformity in filter names, logic, and layout.

5. Incremental Improvements
	•	Roll out changes in stages to allow for testing and feedback.
	•	Use the sandbox environment for validation before production updates.
